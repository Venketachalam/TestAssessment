# GrantInspection-IOS

The head of maintenance and inspection department receives the grants requests from the social studies department.
The requests been studied and distributed to the engineers. The requests will be delivered also in a shape of app notifications.Requests need to be done during 5 days.

The engineers should get starting their trips as per the projects/ units location > the app should sort these locations to the engineers so they could be done the fastest route. 
Engineers tend to create their simplified report for each project/ unit after their visits. 

Inside the simplified report they can add as much "منشأ" as there is in the project/unit - the number of these added will form the report as a whole. 

Each "منشأ" could contain satellite images and normal images - the satellite images will get the app to open a map (integrated either with Google or Apple) and add pins of "منشأ", while the normal ones will just use the camera of the device. 

Once the report is ready Engineer can View/ Edit and Submit it.
